1. Pinout GPIO to the PCB

2. Fix memory(EPROM) footprint

3. align the edge pins so that it fits in a nice circle

4. POT's SPI interface needs better renaming. Currently it is qutie confusing 

5. use 100K pot for the LED driver

6. reverse the sink/source polarity for LED

7. Edit the foot print of the mechanical connectors to make sure they align well.

8. DC path needs to be changes to support current limits of LED driver

9. LTM needs to produce 5.5V rails and 3.3V raile for LED driver and digital stuff, repectively. 3.3 is dropped to 1.2 via LDO.

10. Potentially replace the SMA with Hirose MMCX 


Problems from animal testing: 

11. serdes needs to have reduncdant power + gnd connection to the intan board 
 
12. LED +/- terminals needs to be on the analog intan baord (for the ease of removing serdes). 

13. 10KHz interfernce on some channels

14. change connector polarity on the headstage 

15. put a status LED on the FPGA to indicate programming completed. 

16. put status LEDs on the FPGA to indicate current states on the main statemachine
