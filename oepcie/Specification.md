[MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)

## Purpose
Configure hardware and read and write streaming data from and to a host
applications.

## Design Requirements
- Low latency (sub millisecond)
- High bandwidth (> 1000 neural data channels)
- Support for different hardware components on a single PCIe bus
    - Support generic mixes of hardware elements
    - Generic configuration channels
    - Generic data input stream
    - Generic data output stream
- Usable by different host applications
- Support multiple PCIe devices on one PC
- Cross platform

## Language
Implementation shall be in C to facilitate cross platform and cross-language
use.

## Scope and External Dependencies
- This is a low level library used by high-level library and or application
  plugin developers. It is not meant to be used by neuroscientists directly.

- The only external dependency aside from the c standard library is
  [Xillybus](http://xillybus.com/), which will be used for PCIe communication.
  Because xillybus provides abstracts this functionality to the level of file
  IO, a drop in replacement without its commercial restrictions is possible if
  open-ephys ever gathers the funds to do so.

- The public programming interface, supported device ID enumeration, and public
  type declarations should be limited to a single header file.

## Types and Definitions

### Context
A _context_ (`oe_ctx`) holds all required state for a devices associated with
one PCIe bus in the following hierarchy:

``` {.c}
typedef struct stream_fid {
    char *path;
    int fid;
} stream_fid_t;

typedef struct oe_ctx_impl {
    // Communication channels
    stream_fid_t config;
    stream_fid_t data;
    stream_fid_t signal;

    // Devices
    oe_size_t num_dev;
    oe_device_t* dev_map;

    // Frame sizes (bytes)
    oe_size_t read_frame_size;
    oe_size_t write_frame_size;

    // Acqusition state
    enum run_state {
        CTXNULL = 0,
        UNINITIALIZED,
        IDLE,
        RUNNING
    } run_state;

} oe_ctx_impl_t;
```

State details should be hidden in implementation file (.c). A pointer to opaque
type (handle) is exposed publicly in header (.h)

```
// .h
typedef struct oe_ctx_impl *oe_ctx;
```

API calls will typically take a context handle as the first argument and use it
to look up required state information to enable communication, or to add mutate
the context to reflect some function side effect (e.g. add device map
information).

```
int oe_api_function(oe_ctx ctx, ...);
```

### Device
A _device_ (`oe_device_t`) is defined as configurable piece of hardware with
its own register address space (e.g. an integrated circuit) or something
programmed within the firmware to emulate this (e.g. a MUX or microcontroller
implemented in the FPGA's logic). On the FPGA firmware, each device corresponds
to a module with several standard methods (TOD0: Elaborate on this!). Host
interaction with a device is facilitated using a description, which is provided
by a `struct` as follows:

``` {.c}
typedef struct oe_device {
    device_id_t id;
    int         read_offset;
    size_t      read_size;
    int         write_offset;
    size_t      write_size;
} oe_device_t;
```
The definition of each member of `oe_device_t` is provided below:

1. `enum config_device_id`: Device ID number which is globally enumerated for the
   entire project
    - e.g. Intan RHD2032 could be 0, Intan RHD2064 could 1, etc.
    - e.g. MWL001GPIOMUX is a MUX implemented in the headstage FPGA that is
      used to route SERDES GPIO lines
    - This enum grows with the number of devices supported by the library.
      There is a single enum for the entire library which enumerates all
      possible devices that are controlled across `context` configurations.
    - Each `context` is only responsible for controlling a subset of all
      supported devices.

    ```
    typedef enum device_id {
        RHD2032,
        RHD2064
        MPU9250,
        MWL001GPIOMUX,
        ...
    } oe_device_id_t
    ```

2. `int read_offset`: Byte count offset within a data frame that this
   device's data can be found
    - -1 indicates that no data is sent by the device
3. `size_t read_size`:  bytes of each transmitted data frame from this device.
    - 0 indicates that it does not send data.
4. `int write_offset`: Byte count offset within data frame that this
   device's write data can be written
    - -1 indicates that no data can be written to the device
5. `size_t write_size`:  bytes within the output frame transmitted data packet
   to this device.
    - 0 indicates that it does not send data.

Following a hardware reset which is triggered either by a call to `oe_init_ctx`
or to `oe_set_ctx` with the appropriate option, the device map is pushed onto
the singal stream by the FPGA as COBS encoded packets. The device map looks
like this on the signal stream, where | represents '0' packet delimiters.

... | DEVICEMAPACK, uint32_t num_devices | FRAMERSIZE, uint32_t read_frame_size
    | FRAMEWSIZE, uint32_t write_frame_size | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_0
    | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_1 | ... | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_n| ...

During a call to `oe_init_ctx`, the device map is decoded from the singal stream and used to populate the appropriate files in the current context. Here, packet contains a flag header defined as



### Frame
A _frame_ is a flat byte array containing a single sample's worth of read
or write data for an entire device map. This is the data format produced by
`oe_read` and sent to `oe_write`. Data within a frame is arranged as follows:

```
[32 byte header, dev_0 data, dev_1 data, ... , dev_n data, padding]
```

Read-frames and write-frames have different structures since some devices
produce data and some do not. Read-frame and write-frame information for a
particular hardware configuration is provided by the FPGA firmware. It is
captured by the host during `oe_init_ctx` and can be examined via calls to
`oe_get_opt`, e.g. to find device read and write offsets and sizes within each
frame.  Ideally, calls to `oe_read` and `oe_write` should provide buffers  of
appropriate size to to fit an integer number of full frames, although this is
not necessary. A frame is divided into three data sections:

1. Header
    - Frame metadata containing sample numbers and (TODO) error correction codes
    - For read-frames (`oe_read`) header contains
        - bytes 0-8: uint64_t frame number
        - bytes 9-32: reserved
    - For write-frames (`oe_write`) header contains
        - bytes 0-32: reserved
2. Data
    - Raw data blocks from each device in the device map.
    - The ordering of device-specific blocks is the same as the device index
      within the map
    - The read/write offsets for each device-specific block is provided in the
      device map
    - Data block type information is provided in device specific manual file,
      in this repository (TODO)
    - Perhaps in the future, data type casting information can be provided in
      the device map, but this is not currently implemented

3. Padding
    - The read and write frame may require padding 0's at the end of the frame
      in order to make the frame size a multiple of 32-bits, which is the width
      of the FIFO that is used. This allows frames to fall on the FIFO's
      natural data boundaries for effecient reading and writing.

### FPGA/Host Communication Channels
The library supports communication over the following channels

#### Signal channel (8-bit, asynchronous, read only)

- Provides a way for the firmware to inform host of configuration results and
  the device map  available devices
- Communicates with host using a
  [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing)
  stream.
    - Packets are delimited using 0's
    - Packets always have the following format: [PACKET-FLAG, data...]
    - Packet flags are defined as follows
``` {.c}
typedef enum oe_signal {
    NULLSIG             = (1u << 0),
    CONFIGWACK          = (1u << 1), // Configuration write-acknowledgement
    CONFIGWNACK         = (1u << 2), // Configuration no-write-acknowledgement
    CONFIGRACK          = (1u << 3), // Configuration read-acknowledgement
    CONFIGRNACK         = (1u << 4), // Configuration no-read-acknowledgement
    DEVICEMAPACK        = (1u << 5), // Device map start acnknowledgement
    FRAMERSIZE          = (1u << 6), // Frame read size in bytes
    FRAMEWSIZE          = (1u << 7), // Frame write size in bytes
    DEVICEINST          = (1u << 8), // Deivce map instance
} oe_signal_t;
```
- The signal stream details are not exposed to the programmer, and so these
  definitions are private.
- Following a hardware reset, the signal channel is used to provide the device
  map and frame information to the host using the following packet sequence:

... | DEVICEMAPACK, uint32_t num_devices | FRAMERSIZE, uint32_t read_frame_size
    | FRAMEWSIZE, uint32_t write_frame_size | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_0
    | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_1 | ... | DEVICEINST oe_device_t dev_n| ...

- Following a device register read or write, ACK or NACK signals are pushed
  onto the signal stream by the firmware. e.g. on a successful register read:

... | CONFIGRACK, uint32_t register value | ...

#### Configuration channel (32-bit, synchronous, read and write)

- This channel supports seeking to, reading, and writing the following
  registers, which form a device register programming interface. On the host
  side, these registers are used through calls to `oe_reg_read` and
  `oe_reg_write`

    - `uint32_t config_device_id`: Device ID register. Specify a device endpoint as
      enumerated by the firmware (e.g. an Intan chip, or a IMU chip)  and
      to which communication will be directed using `config_reg_addr` and
      `config_reg_value`.

    - `uint32_t config_reg_addr`: register address of configuration to be
      written

    - `uint32_t config_reg_value`: configuration value to be written to or
      read from and that corresponds to `config_reg_addr` on device
      `config_device_id`

    - `uint32_t config_rw`: bit indicating if a read or write should be
      performed. 0 indicates read operation. >0 indicates write operation.

    - `uint32_t config_trig`: set >0 to trigger either register read or
      write operation depending on the state of `config_rw`. If `config_rw`
      is 0, a read is performed. In this case `config_reg_value` is updated
      with value stored at `config_reg_addr` on device at
      `config_device_id`. If the specified register is not readable,
      `config_reg_value` is populated with a magic number (`OE_REGMAGIC`).
      If `config_rw`is 1, `config_reg_value` is written to register at
      `config_reg_addr` on device `config_device_id`. The `config_trig`
      register shall always be set low by the firmware following
      transmission even if it is not successful or does not make sense
      given the address register values.

- This channel also supports seeking to, reading, and writing the following
  registers, which form are provide access to acquisition parameters and state
  control.

    - `uint32_t running`: set to >0 to run the system clock and produce data

    - `uint32_t reset`: set to >0 to trigger hardware reset

    - `uint32_t sys_clock_hz`: the frequency of the system clock from which all
      others (including the frame clock) are derived.

    - `uint32_t frame_clock_hz`: the data frame frequency at which data frames
      are pushed to and frame the data input and output FIFOs.

    - `uint32_t running`: set to > 0 to run the system clock and produce data

    - `uint32_t reset`: set to > 0 to trigger a hardware reset and send a fresh
      device map to the host

    - `uint32_t sys_clock_hz`: A read-only register specifying the base
      hardware clock frequency in Hz.

    - `uint32_t frame_clock_hz`: A read-only register specifying the frame clock
      frequency in Hz. This is a function of the current value of clock muliply
      and divide registers specified below.
      device map to the host

    - `uint32_t frame_clock_m`: Frame clock divider numerator value.

    - `uint32_t frame_clock_d`: Frame clock divider denominator value.

- Appropriate values of `config_reg_addr` and `config_reg_value` are determined
  by:
    - Looking at a device's data sheet if the device is an integrated circuit
    - Looking at the verilog source code comments if the device exists as a
      module that is implemented within the FPGA (e.g a MUX) or as a
      verilog module that abstracts a PCB or sub-circuit (e.g. a
      digital IO port).

- `config_reg_addr` and `config_reg_value` are always 32-bit unsigned
  integers. A device module must implement methods for appropriately
  translating these values into data that is properly fomatted for a a
  particular device (e.g. changing endianness or removing significant
  bits).

- `SEEK` locations of each configuration register, relative to the start of the
  stream, are provided by the `oe_config_reg` enum.

- Upon a call to `oe_write_reg`, the following actions take place:

    1. The value of `config_trig` is checked.
        - If it is 0x00, the function call proceeds.
        - Else, the function call returns with OE_ERETRIG.
    1. `dev_idx` is copied to the `config_device_id` register on the host FPGA.
    1. `addr` is copied to the `config_reg_addr` register on the host FPGA.
    1. `value` is copied to the `config_reg_value` register on the host FPGA.
    1. The `config_rw` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01.
    1. The `config_trig` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01, triggering
       configuration transmission by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) A configuration write is performed by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) `config_trig` is set to 0x00 by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) `OE_CONFIGWACK` is pushed onto the signal stream by the firmware.
    1. The signal stream is pumped until `OE_CONFIGWACK` is received indicating
       that the host FPGA has attempted to write to the specified device
       register.

- Upon a call to `oe_write_reg`, the following actions take place:

    1. The value of `config_trig` is checked.
        - If it is 0x00, the function call proceeds.
        - Else, the function call returns with OE_ERETRIG.
    1. `dev_idx` is copied to the `config_device_id` register on the host FPGA.
    1. `addr` is copied to the `config_reg_addr` register on the host FPGA.
    1. The `config_rw` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x00.
    1. The `config_read_trig` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01, triggering
       configuration transmission by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) A configuration read is performed by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) `config_trig` is set to 0x00 by the firmware.
    1. (Firmware) `OE_CONFIGRACK` is pushed onto the signal stream by the firmware.
    1. The signal stream is pumped until `OE_CONFIGRACK` is received indicating
       that the host FPGA has completed reading the specified device register
       and copied its value to the `config_reg_value` register.

- Following successful or unsuccessful device register read or write, the COBS encoded ACK or NACK packets must be passed to the signal stream.

#### Data input channel (32-bit, asynchronous, read-only)
    - High-bandwidth communication channel from firmware to host.
    - FIFO is filled with untyped data once per master clock cycle
    - Packet size is determined by the attached device IDs and the device Data Map

#### TODO: Data output channel (32-bit, asynchronous, write-only)
    - High-bandwidth  communication channel from host to firmware
    - FIFO is filled with untyped data once per master clock cycle

- `oe_reg_value_t`: Fixed width device register value integer type.
- `oe_device_t

#### `oe_ctx`
Opaque handle to a structure which contains hardware and device state
information. There is generally one context per process using the library.

#### `oe_opt_t`
Context option enumeration. See `oe_set_opt` and `oe_get_opt` for valid values.

#### `oe_device_id_t`
Device identiy enumeration. Provides agreed-upon, liboepcie-specific IDs for
all devices supported by the firmware.

    OE_RHD2064,
    OE_MPU9250,
} oe_device_id_t;
```

#### `oe_device_t`
One of potentially many pieces of hardware within a context. Examples include
Intan chips, IMU, stimulators, immediate IO circuit, auxiliary ADC, etc. Each
valid device type has a unqique ID which is enumerated in `oe_device_id_t`. A
map of available devices is stored in the current context via `oe_init_ctx`.
This map can be examined via calls to `oe_get_opt`.

``` {.c}
typedef struct oe_device {
    oe_dev_id_t id;
    oe_size_t read_offset;
    oe_size_t read_size;
    oe_size_t write_offset;
    oe_size_t write_size;
} oe_device_t;
```

#### `oe_error_t`
Error code enumeration.

``` {.c}
typedef enum oe_error {
    OE_ESUCCESS         =  0,  // Success
    OE_EPATHINVALID     = -1,  // Invalid stream path, fail on open
    OE_EREINITCTX       = -2,  // Double initialization attempt
    OE_EDEVID           = -3,  // Invalid device ID on init or reg op

    OE_EINVALOPT        = -10, // Invalid context option
    OE_EINVALARG        = -11, // Invalid function arguments
    OE_ECANTSETOPT      = -12, // Option cannot be set in current context state
    OE_ECOBSPACK        = -13, // Invalid COBS packet
    OE_ERETRIG          = -14, // Attempt to trigger an already triggered operation
    OE_EBUFFERSIZE      = -15, // Supplied buffer is too small

    OE_EDATATYPE        = -19, // Invalid underlying data types
    OE_EREADONLY        = -20, // Attempted write to read only object (register, context option, etc)
    OE_ERUNSTATESYNC    = -21, // Software and hardware run state out of sync
} oe_error_t;
```

### oe_create_ctx
Create a hardware context. A context is an opaque handle to a structure which
contains hardware and device state information, configuration capabilities, and
data format information. It can be modified via calls to `oe_set_opt`. Its
state can be examined by `oe_get_opt`.

``` {.c}
oe_ctx oe_create_ctx();
```

#### Returns `oe_ctx`
- An opaque handle to the newly created context if successful. Otherwise it
  shall return NULL and set errno to `EAGAIN`

#### Description
On success a context struct is allocated and created, and its handle is passed
to the user. The context holds all state used to communicate with a set of
hardware devices. It holds paths to FIFOs and configuration communication
channels and knowledge of the hardware's run state. It is configured through
calls to `oe_set_opt`. It can be examined through calls to `oe_get_opt`.

### oe_destroy_ctx
Terminate a context and free bound resources.

``` {.c}
int oe_destroy_ctx(oe_ctx ctx)
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
During context destruction, all resources allocated by `oe_create_ctx` are
freed. This function can be called from any context run state. When called, an
interrupt signal (TOD0: Which?) is raised and any blocking operations will
return immediately. Attached resources (e.g. file descriptors and allocated
memory) are closed and their resources freed.

### oe_init
Initialize a context, opening all file streams etc.

``` {.c}
int oe_init_ctx(oe_ctx *c)
```

#### Arguments
- `c` context

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
Upon a call to `oe_init_ctx`, the following actions take place

1. All required data streams are opened.
2. A device map is read from the firmware. It can be examined via calls t
   `oe_get_opt`.

Following a successful call to `oe_init_ctx`, the hardware's acqusition
parameters and run state can be manipulated using calls to `oe_get_opt`.

### oe_get_opt
Get context options. NB: This follows the pattern of
[zmq_getsockopt()](http://api.zeromq.org/4-1:zmq-getsockopt).

``` {.c}
int oe_get_opt(const oe_ctx ctx, const oe_opt_t option, void* value, size_t *size);
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context to read from
- `option` option to read
- `value` buffer to store value of `option`
- `size` pointer to the size of `value` (including terminating null character,
  if applicable) in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
The `oe_get_opt`() function shall set the option specified by the `option`
argument to the value pointed to by the `value` argument for the context
pointed to by the `ctx` argument. The `size` provides a pointer to the size of
the option value in bytes. Upon successful completion `oe_get_opt` shall modify
the value pointed to by `size` to indicate the actual size of the option value
stored in the buffer.

### oe_set_opt
Set context options. NB: This follows the pattern of
[zmq_setsockopt()](http://api.zeromq.org/4-1:zmq-setsockopt).

``` {.c}
int oe_set_opt(oe_ctx ctx, const oe_opt_t option, const void* value, size_t size);
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context
- `option` option to set
- `value` value to set `option` to
- `size` length of `value` in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
The `oe_set_opt` function shall set the option specified by the `option`
argument to the value pointed to by the `value` argument within `ctx`. The
`size` indicates the size of the `value` in bytes.

The following socket options can be set:

|`OE_CONFIGSTREAMPATH`\*  	| Set URI specifying config data stream. |
|-|-|
| option value type         | char * |
| option value unit         | N/A |
| default value             | file:///dev/xillybus_oe_config_32 |

|`OE_DATASTEAMPATH`\*  	    | Set URI specifying input data stream.  |
|-|-|
| option value type         | char * |
| option value unit         | N/A |
| default value             | file:///dev/xillybus_oe_input_32 |

|`OE_SIGNALSTREAMPATH`\*  	| Set URI specifying hardware signal data stream |
|-|-|
| option value type 	    | char * |
| option value unit 	    | N/A |
| default value     	    | file:///dev/xillybus_oe_signal_32 |

|`OE_RUNNING`\*\*  	        | Set/clear master clock gate |
|-|-|
| option value type 	    | oe_reg_val_t |
| option value unit 	    | True or false (i.e. 0 or not 0) |
| default value     	    | False |

Any value greater than 0 will start acqusition. Writing 0 to this option will stop acqusition, but will not reset context options or the sample counter.

|`OE_RESET`\*\*  	        | Trigger global hardware reset |
|-|-|
| option value type 	    | oe_reg_val_t |
| option value unit 	    | Trigger (i.e. any value greater than 0) |
| default value     	    | Untriggered |

Any value great than 0 will trigger a hardware reset. In this case, acqusition
is stopped and all global hardware parameters (clock multipliers, sample
counters, etc) are defaulted.

|`OE_FSCLM`\*\*  	        | Set sample clock multiplier |
|-|-|
| option value type 	    | oe_reg_val_t |
| option value unit 	    | Sample clock ratio numerator |
| default value     	    | 3 |

Used to derive the sample clock frequency from the system clock. The sample
clock frequncy = M * system clock frequency / D;

|`OE_FSCLD`\*\*  	        | Set sample clock divider |
|-|-|
| option value type 	    | oe_reg_val_t |
| option value unit 	    | Sample clock ratio denominator |
| default value     	    | 10000 |

Used to derive the sample clock frequency from the system clock. The sample
clock frequncy = M * system clock frequency / D;

\* Invalid following a successful call to `oe_init()`. In this case, will return with error code `OE_EINVALSTATE`.
\*\* Invalid until a succesful call to `oe_init()`. In this case, will return with error code `OE_EINVALSTATE`.

### oe_read_reg
Read a configuration register on a specific device.

``` {.c}
int oe_read_reg(const oe_ctx ctx, const oe_dev_idx_t dev_idx, const oe_reg_addr_t addr, oe_reg_val_t *value)
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context
- `dev_idx` physical index number
- `addr` Thekey of register to write to
- `value` pointer to an int that will store the value of the register at `addr` on `dev_idx`

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
`oe_read_reg` is used to read the value of configuration registers from devices
within the current device map. This can be used to verify the success of calls
to `oe_read_reg` or to obtain state information about devices managed by the
current context.

### oe_write_reg
Set a configuration register on a specific device.

``` {.c}
int oe_write_reg(const oe_ctx ctx, const oe_dev_idx_t dev_idx, const oe_reg_addr_t addr, const oe_reg_val_t value)
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context
- `dev_idx` the device index to read from
- `addr` register address within the device specified by `dev_idx` to write
  to
- `value` value with which to set the register at `addr` on the device
  specified by `dev_idx`

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
`oe_write_reg` is used to write the value of configuration registers from
devices within the current device map. This can be used to set configuraiton
registers for devices managed by the current context. For example, this is used
to perform configuration of ADCs that exist in a device map. Note that
successful return from this function does not guarantee that the register has
been properly set. Confirmation of the register value can be made using a call
to `oe_read_reg`.

### oe_read
Read high-bandwidth input data stream.

``` {.c}
int oe_read(const oe_ctx ctx, void *data, size_t size)
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context
- `data` buffer to read data into
- `size` size of buffer in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
`oe_read` reads data from a asynchronous input buffer into host memory. The
layout of retrieved data is determined by a particular hardware configuration
and corresponding device map. Each data frame corresponds to a round-robin
through all data producing devices in the device map. The read byte offsets of each
device within a data frame can be found by examining the device map via calls
to `oe_get_opt`.

### oe_write
NB: Not implemented in first version
Write data to an open stream

``` {.c}
int oe_write(const oe_ctx ctx, void *data, size_t size)
```

#### Arguments
- `ctx` context
- `data` buffer to read data into
- `size` size of buffer in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

#### Description
`oe_write` writes data into an asynchronous output stream from host memory. The
layout of output data is determined by a particular hardware configuration, and
corresponding device map. Data placed into the stream corresponds to a
round-robin through all data accepting devices in the device map. The wite byte
offsets of each device within a data frame can be found by examining the device
map via calls to `oe_get_opt`.

### oe_error
Convert an instance of `oe_error_t` into a human readable string.

``` {.c}
void oe_error(oe_error_t err, char *str, size_t size);
```

#### Arguments
- `err` error code
- `str` string buffer
- `size` size of string buffer in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`

### oe_error
Convert an instance of `oe_device_id_t` into human readable string.

``` {.c}
int oe_device(const oe_device_id_t dev_id, char *str, size_t size);
```

#### Arguments
- `dev_id` device id
- `str` string buffer
- `size` size of string buffer in bytes

#### Returns `int`
- 0: success
- Less than 0: `oe_error_t`
